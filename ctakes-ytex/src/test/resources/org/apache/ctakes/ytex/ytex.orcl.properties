# jdbc url for database.  
# Replace localhost:1521:orcl with the host, port and service name/SID of your database
# another format that works is e.g.: jdbc:oracle:thin:ytex/ytex@localhost:1521:orcl
db.url=jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:orcl

# oracle username and password
# user needs connect, resource, and create view privileges
db.username=ytex_test
db.password=ytex_test

# database schema 
# typically identical to username
# alternatively, the user must have access to the schema
db.schema=ytex_test

# the schema where umls is installed
# if not specified, will default to schema from ytex
#umls.schema=umls


# you should not have to modify anything below
# hibernate database dialect
# specify Oracle8iDialect, Oracle9iDialect, or Oracle10gDialect
# can use Oracle10gDialect for Oracle11
hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.Oracle10gDialect

db.type=orcl
db.driver=oracle.jdbc.driver.OracleDriver

# transaction isolation level
db.isolationLevel=READ_COMMITTED
